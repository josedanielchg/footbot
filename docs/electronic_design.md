## Electronic Circuitry

In the electronic design of the robot, we have a straightforward but effective setup. The circuit includes a main power switch that allows you to turn the entire system on and off. The power from the batteries is fed into the LN298N motor driver module. 

The LN298N module is responsible for controlling the motors. We have two motors connected to it: one for the left side and one for the right side, allowing differential steering. The specific type of motors we're using can be added here: **[MOTOR_TYPE_PLACEHOLDER]**. Similarly, the batteries powering the system are **[BATTERY_TYPE_PLACEHOLDER]**.

The ESP32 is connected to the LN298N and controls it by sending signals to move the motors in the desired direction. The ESP32 also handles Wi-Fi connectivity, allowing it to receive commands and stream video data.

At the end of this section, you can insert a wiring diagram that visually represents the connections between the batteries, the switch, the LN298N module, the motors, and the ESP32: **[INSERT_CIRCUIT_DIAGRAM_HERE]**.
